# Linear-Regression
The basic implementation of Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression using small, simple toy datasets.
1. Simple Linear Regression: Fit a Linear Regession model on a toy dataset that has the height and weight of 23 people. Evaluated various performance metrics and also compared the sklearn Linear Regression model with the OLS Regression model from statsmodels.
2. Multiple Linear Regression: Fit a Multiple Regression model on a toy dataset that has the price index, with interest rate and unemployment rate. Evaluated various performance metrics and also compared the sklearn Linear Regression model with the OLS Regression model from statsmodels.
3. Polynomial Regression: Applied Polynomial Transformation to perform Polynomial Regression on a synthetic dataset which emulates a quadratic function as the target function. Also used a pipeline to transform features into polynomial form, applied Linear Regression and plotted the best fit curve. This allows us to visualize the best fit curve for polynomials of different degrees.
